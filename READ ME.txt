Adaptive Tic Tac Toe & Connect 4
This Java project features two classic grid-based games:
- A fully customizable Tic Tac Toe, going beyond the traditional 3×3 grid
- Connect 4 with a standard 6×7 board.

To start a game, compile and run the program from your command prompt.

Tic Tac Toe
How to Play
Use the following command format:
java TTTmain <rows> <columns> <tokensToWin>
Arguments:
rows – Number of rows for the game board.
columns – Number of columns for the game board.
tokensToWin – Number of consecutive tokens required to win (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal).
This value must be less than or equal to the larger of the row or column count.

Game Notes:
At the start, you’ll choose between 1-player and 2-player mode.
In single-player mode, the computer opponent is smart — it cannot lose on a 3×3 grid.
If you find you’re winning instantly in single-player, you’ve likely picked a grid size and win condition that guarantees a player win.

Recommended Configurations:
java TTTmain 3 3 3   # Classic Tic Tac Toe
java TTTmain 5 5 4   # 5×5 grid, 4 in a row to win
java TTTmain 10 10 7 # Large grid, longer win condition

If no arguments are provided, a default 3×3 game is started:
java TTTmain        # Classic Tic Tac Toe
