Adaptive Tic Tac Toe
This is a customizable Tic Tac Toe game built in Java, designed to go beyond the traditional 3x3 grid format.

How to Play
To start a game, compile and run the program from your command prompt.
Use the following command format:

java GameMain <players> <rows> <columns> <tokensToWin>
Arguments:
players – Number of players (1 for single-player vs. computer, 2 for two-player mode).

rows – Number of rows for the game board.

columns – Number of columns for the game board.

tokensToWin – Number of consecutive tokens required to win (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal).
This value must be less than or equal to the larger of the row or column count.

Notes:
In single-player mode, the computer opponent plays randomly.

The game works with any grid size, making it more challenging and adaptable than classic Tic Tac Toe.
